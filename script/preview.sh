# NOTE:
# All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should
# prefix them with 'bundle exec' so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll
# that is installed in project folder.

# Build and watch for changes, regenerated automatically
# bundle exec jekyll build --watch

# Preview site and enabled auto-regeneration
bundle exec jekyll serve
